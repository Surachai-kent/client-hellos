# Active TLS Stack Fingerprinting Client Hellos

Client Hellos (CHs) related to the publication [Active TLS Stack Fingerprinting: Characterizing TLS Server Deployments at Scale](https://active-tls-fingerprinting.github.io/).
The CHs have been empirically optimized to be used as general-purpose CHs for fingerprinting TLS servers.
